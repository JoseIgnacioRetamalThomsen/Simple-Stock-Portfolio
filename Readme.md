I chose to develop the solution in GoLand because it was a great challenge and allowed me to remember the language that I had used only once in my university final project five years ago.

Problem:
Construct a simple Portfolio class that has a collection of Stocks. Assume each Stock has a “Current Price” method that receives the last available price. Also, the Portfolio class has a collection of “allocated” Stocks that represents the distribution of the Stocks the Portfolio is aiming (i.e. 40% META, 60% APPL)
Provide a portfolio rebalance method to know which Stocks should be sold and which ones should be bought to have a balanced Portfolio based on the portfolio’s allocation.
Add documentation/comments to understand your thinking process and solution
Important: If you use LLMs that’s ok, but you must share the conversations.
